# mkSpark

Make a Spark container PDQ

### Usage

To pull the image from DockerHub

```
make pull
```

or to build the image locally

```
make build
```

then

```
make run
```

and you have a running spark container

```
make pi
```

should return 3.1418, which is not pi but I'm following squenceIQ's documentation at this point
